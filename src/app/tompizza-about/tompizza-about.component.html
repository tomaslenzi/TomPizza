<p>TomPizza´s Pizzeria serves traditional coal-fired brick oven pizza using pizza-making traditions originating in Tandil over 100 years ago. Using only the freshest ingredients, and our "secret recipe" dough that´s hand-tossed and made in house daily, our pizzas are prepared in our signature Coal-Fired Brick Ovens, which helps us deliver an authentic taste that´s not found in conventional oven pizza. We are a family-friendly, casual yet upscale, Buenos Aires-themed restaurant. It is our passion for pizza that has made us a “must eat” for pizza lovers everywhere!</p>
